## About The Project ‚úç

Head Hunter is a user-friendly app that effortlessly connects HR professionals with aspiring IT beginners. Developed by a team of four individuals, including myself, using the Scrum methodology, this innovative platform simplifies the recruitment process while teaching me valuable lessons in remote collaboration and code development. With Head Hunter, HR experts can easily discover and engage with talented individuals in the IT world, fostering seamless connections and empowering newcomers in their journey towards a successful career in technology.

In this project, the user (HR) can create an account, log in, and search for suitable employees while familiarizing themselves with the candidates' preferences.

**Project was a simulation of real work in which the client demanded us to create an application with specific specifications and design. I learned how the Scrum methodology works and how to collaborate with a team to collectively write code.**
